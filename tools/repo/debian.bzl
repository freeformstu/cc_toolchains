If a URL's host name is present in this dict the value will be used as a pattern when
generating the authorization header for the http request. This enables the use of custom
authorization schemes used in a lot of common cloud storage providers.
The pattern currently supports 2 tokens: <code>&lt;login&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;password&gt;</code>, which are replaced with their equivalent value
in the netrc file for the same host name. After formatting, the result is set
as the value for the <code>Authorization</code> field of the HTTP request.
Example attribute and netrc for a http download to an oauth2 enabled API using a bearer token:
<pre>
auth_patterns = {
    "storage.cloudprovider.com": "Bearer &lt;password&gt;"
}
</pre>
netrc:
<pre>
machine storage.cloudprovider.com
        password RANDOM-TOKEN

Authorization: Bearer RANDOM-TOKEN
